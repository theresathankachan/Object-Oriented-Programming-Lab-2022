1. Program to print sum of digits reduced to a single digit.<br>
2. Define a class ‘product’ with data members pcode, pname and price.<br>
Create three objects of the class and find the product having the lowest price.<br>
3. Add complex numbers.<br>
4. Read two matrices from the console and perform matrix addition.<br>
5. Create a class CPU with attribute price. Create an inner class Processor(no. of cores, manufacturer) and a static nested class RAM (memory, manufacturer).
Create an object of CPU and print information of Processor and RAM.<br>
6. Program to Sort strings.<br>
7. Perform string manipulations<br>
8. Create a class Employee having attributes eNo, eName eSalary. Read 'N' employ information and Search for an employee given eNo, using the concept of Array of
Objects.<br>
9. Area of different shapes using overloaded functions.<br>
10. Create a class ‘Person’ with data members Name, Gender, Address, Age and a constructor to initialize the data members and another class ‘Employee’ that inherits the properties of class Person and also contains its own data members like Empid, Company_name, Qualification, Salary and its own constructor. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherits the properties of class Employee and contains its own data members like Subject, Department, Teacherid and contain constructors and methods to display the data members. Use array of objects to display details of N teachers.
11. Create an interface having prototypes of functions area() and perimeter().Create two classes Circle and Rectangle which implements the above interface.
Create a menu driven program to find area and perimeter of objects.<br> 
12. Create a Graphics package that has classes and interfaces for figures Rectangle,Triangle, Square and Circle. Test the package by finding the area of these figures.<br>
13. Write a user defined exception class to authenticate the user name and password.<br>
14. Find the average of N positive integers, raising a user defined exception for each negative input.<br>
15. Define 2 classes; one for generating Fibonacci numbers and other for displaying even numbers in a given range.Implement using threads.(Runnable Interface)<br>
16. Program to create a generic stack and do the Push and Pop operations.<br>
17. Maintain a list of Strings using ArrayList from collection framework, perform built-in operations.<br>
18. Program to demonstrate the creation of queue object using the PriorityQueue class.<br>
19. Program to demonstrate the addition and deletion of elements in deque.<br>
20. Write a Java program to compare two hash set.<br>
21. Program to demonstrate the working of Map interface by adding, changing and removing elements.<br>
22. Program to find maximum of three numbers using AWT.<br>
23. Implement a simple calculator using AWT components.<br> 
24. Develop a program to handle all mouse events and window events.<br>
25. Develop a program to handle Key events.<br>
26. Write a program to write to a file, then read from the file and display the contents on the console.<br>
27. Write a program that reads from a file having integers.Copy even numbers and odd numbers to separate files.<br>
28. Client Server communication using Socket – TCP/IP.<br>
